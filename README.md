# Project Euler Solutions

This repository is a collection of my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.

### The Goal
My primary goal isn't just to get the right answer, but to write clean, readable, and efficient code while enjoying some recreational mathematics.

### The Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** I try to stick to the standard library, but occasionally use `numpy` for matrix heavy-lifting.
